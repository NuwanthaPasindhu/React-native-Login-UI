# React-native-Login-UI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

The modern login UI was developed at React Native Expo.
## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React-native] - javascript cross-platform mobile app development framework
- [Expo] - open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.


Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd React-native-Login-UI
npm i
expo start
```
